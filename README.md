RackPeek is a lightweight, opinionated CLI tool / webui for documenting and managing home lab and small-scale IT infrastructure.

It helps you track hardware, services, networks, and their relationships in a clear, scriptable, and reusable way without enterprise bloat or proprietary lock-in or drowning in unnecessary metadata or process.

RackPeek is open source and community-driven.
Code, docs, ideas, bug reports, and real-world usage feedback are all massively appreciated.
If you run a home lab, you belong here.

### The roadmap for the next wave of features is actively being discussed, please make your voice heard! 

## Contribution Guide

We are now gearing up for the full v1.0.0 release, so development focus is on stability / bug fixes / essential core missing features. Please raise any suggestions / bugs / feedback in the Github issues.

## Questionnaire

We’re gathering feedback from homelabbers to validate direction and prioritize features.  
Answer whichever questions stand out to you, your input directly shapes the project.

## Core Values

**Simplicity**  
RackPeek focuses on clarity and usefulness. Its scope is intentionally kept narrow to avoid unnecessary abstraction and feature creep.

**Ease of Deployment**  
The tool exists to reduce operational complexity. Installation, upgrades, and day-to-day usage should be straightforward and low-friction.

**Openness**  
RackPeek uses open, non-proprietary data formats. You fully own your data and should be free to easily inspect, migrate, or reuse it however you choose.

**Community**  
Contributors of all experience levels are welcome. Knowledge sharing, mentorship, and collaboration are core to the project’s culture.

**Privacy & Security**  
No telemetry, no ads, no tracking, and no artificial restrictions. What runs on your infrastructure stays on your infrastructure.

**Dogfooding**  
RackPeek is built to solve real problems we actively have. If a feature isn’t useful in practice, it doesn’t belong.

**Opinionated**  
The project is optimized for home labs and self-hosted environments, not enterprise CMDBs or corporate documentation workflows.
