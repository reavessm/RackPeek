# RackPeek Documentation

Welcome to the RackPeek knowledge base.

RackPeek is a lightweight, opinionated CLI tool and Web UI for documenting and managing home lab and small-scale IT infrastructure.

It exists to help you understand your infrastructure clearly — without enterprise bloat, proprietary lock-in, or unnecessary process.

---

## What RackPeek Is

RackPeek helps you:

- Document hardware, systems, and services
- Model relationships between components
- Keep infrastructure knowledge versionable and portable
- Treat your lab “as code” using simple YAML
- Turn documentation into automation (e.g. Ansible inventory)

It is intentionally focused on homelabs and self-hosted environments, not enterprise CMDBs.

## Design Philosophy

RackPeek is built around a few core principles:

### Simplicity
Clear models. Minimal abstraction. No unnecessary metadata.

### Openness
Your data is stored in plain YAML. No hidden databases. No lock-in.

### Ease of Deployment
Runs in Docker or as a single binary. Fast to install. Easy to maintain.

### Privacy
No telemetry. No tracking. No ads. What runs on your infrastructure stays on your infrastructure.

### Opinionated
Optimized for real-world home lab use — not corporate documentation workflows.

## Project Status

RackPeek is actively developed and currently in beta.

The focus is on:

- Stability

- Community feedback before v1.0.0

Post-1.0, expansion areas include deeper automation support, diagramming, and infrastructure integrations.

## Community

RackPeek is open source and community-driven.

If you:
- Run a homelab
- Self-host services
- Experiment with infrastructure
- Care about documenting what you build

You belong here.

Feedback, bug reports, ideas, and contributions are always welcome.
